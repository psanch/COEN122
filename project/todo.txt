TODO:

**instruction memory is an 8-bit address instead of 32-bit

**control we are setting LDPC,INCREMENT and ADD as A+B: for the first two we need B = 1;

Control Unit:
  Takes in 4 bit opcode

  spit out (13 bits)
    ryan does:
    5 bit exout
    7 bit memout

--
Create an instruction set(HEX or BIN)
if we use hex we have to convert
--
Configure the ControlUnit
--
configure all our files from previous labs to collaborate all of our old work:
  we will need the adder in the tester
  connect instruction_memory -> IF/ID Buffer
